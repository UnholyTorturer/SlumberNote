On 15 April, 2024, I had a dream about a note taking app. I woke up the next morning and started banging it out. This is that app. I published it in the hopes that others might find it useful. I have plans to improve it over time and will be doing that as I find the time. 

If you try this app out, try clicking the tools first to see the help file, which explains a bit about how it works and all that.

Yes, I know the Purple UI is terrible. I'm not much of a graphic designer.
