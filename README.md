On 15 April, 2024, I had a dream about a note taking app. I woke up the next morning and started banging it out. This is that app. I published it in the hopes that others might find it useful. I have plans to improve it over time and will be doing that as I find the time. 

If you try this app out, try clicking the tools first to see the help file, which explains a bit about how it works and all that.

Yes, I know the Purple UI is terrible. I'm not much of a graphic designer. 

Python 3.11 or later is required to run this app.

If you do not have Python on your PC and you want to try SlumberNote, you can install Python 3.11 from the Microsoft Store.
